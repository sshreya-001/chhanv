            <p>CHAANV WELFARE believes that until and unless members of the civil society are involved actively in the process of change and development, nothing can happen. 
             To make this change happen, we invite you to come and be part of the Save the Children volunteer program, come and join us to work for the welfare of poor children and underprivileged children and their families.
             We truly believe that volunteers are the backbone of every organization not only do they carry the organization’s ideals within them and help the organization in implementing them on the ground, they also spread the message far and beyond, sensitizing the society towards the cause.<br>

            <p> 1.	Sponsor a child - You are welcome to sponsor these abandoned orphan children for their education or living expenses. You can come yourselves or you can send your friends to our Children Home to spend time with these kids. The children will feel that someone cares about their future and feel happy. Donors are free to contribute any amount as desired, which will be utilized for the running of orphanage. You can celebrate your special day with the children, sponsor health care or sponsor annual expenses for a specific child.<br><br>
                2.	Sponsor a child’s education - 32 million Indian children of age up to 13 years have never attended any school, the majority of them belonging to the socially disadvantaged class or poor families. In addition, 47 million children of secondary and higher secondary school-going age dropped out of school. Most government schools have a poor quality infrastructure, and lack teachers. Children mired in poverty are forced to drop out of school and find ways to survive. Shockingly, there are more than 33 million child laborers below the age of 18 years in India, whereas they should be in school.
