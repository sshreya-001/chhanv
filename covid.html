            <p>
                India has been under restrictions since 25 March 2020 to control Covid-19 pandemic, causing mass layoffs and heavy job losses. Millions of desperate migrant workers, particularly daily-wage earners, facing starvation after losing jobs are fleeing cities on foot to return to their villages. Help promised by state governments in terms of cash transfers and free ration kit distribution has not reached many sections, due to the sheer numbers involved and lack of ration cards with migrant guest workers.
                <br>
                <br>  
                We directly donate food, needy essentials to homeless people, and poor families impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Daily wage workers, migrant workers rendered jobless by the current COVID-19 pandemic and they need our timely support to prevent hunger.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let us fight corona together by extending our donations to such affected persons, in turn, help their families in this emergency disaster situation.
                We have been providing relief to sections of the community affected by the pandemic. We have in place a team of well-trained volunteers to identify people who need relief.
